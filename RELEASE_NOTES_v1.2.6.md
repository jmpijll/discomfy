# üîß DisComfy v1.2.6: Smart Config Migration & LoRA Fixes

**Release Date:** January 29, 2025  
**Type:** Config Migration & Bug Fix Release

---

## üåü **What's New**

This release introduces **Smart Config Migration** that automatically updates existing configuration files with new workflows while preserving all user settings. Plus critical LoRA selector fixes for better compatibility across different server setups.

---

## üöÄ **Smart Config Migration System**

### **üîÑ Automatic Upgrades**
- **‚úÖ Auto-Detection**: Bot detects missing workflows in existing `config.json` files
- **‚úÖ Smart Addition**: Adds missing workflows from `config.example.json` or built-in defaults
- **‚úÖ User Settings Preserved**: Keeps all customizations (IPs, tokens, timeouts, etc.) untouched
- **‚úÖ Future-Proof**: New workflow releases automatically added to existing installations

### **üéØ What This Solves**
Your existing `config.json` was missing the `flux_krea_lora` workflow we added in v1.2.2. Now:
1. **Bot startup detects missing workflows**
2. **Automatically adds `flux_krea_lora` configuration**
3. **Saves updated config.json with your preserved settings**
4. **Flux Krea ‚ú® NEW model now works perfectly!**

---

## üêõ **LoRA Selector Fixes**

### **üéØ The Problem**
- LoRA selector wasn't appearing for Flux models on servers where all LoRAs have 'hidream' in their filename
- Overly strict filtering returned empty results, hiding the LoRA selector entirely

### **‚úÖ The Solution**
- **Intelligent Fallback**: If strict filtering finds no flux-specific LoRAs, allows all LoRAs
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear debug info about LoRA filtering decisions
- **Server Compatibility**: Works on any server regardless of LoRA naming conventions
- **Universal LoRA Access**: Flux models can now use any available LoRA when needed

---

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Config Migration Process**
```
1. Load existing config.json
2. Compare with config.example.json workflows
3. Detect missing workflows (e.g., flux_krea_lora)
4. Add missing entries without touching user settings
5. Save updated config.json automatically
6. Log what workflows were added
```

### **LoRA Filtering Enhancement**
```python
# Before: Strict filtering could return empty list
filtered = [lora for lora in loras if 'hidream' not in lora['filename'].lower()]

# After: Smart fallback ensures LoRAs are always available
if not filtered and loras:
    self.logger.warning("No flux-specific LoRAs found, allowing all LoRAs")
    filtered = loras
```

## üìä **Your Specific Fixes**

### **Configuration Issues Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **flux_krea_lora workflow**: Now automatically added to your config
- ‚úÖ **Flux Krea model**: Will appear and work properly in dropdown
- ‚úÖ **User settings preserved**: Your ComfyUI URL (172.27.1.134:8188) and all other settings kept
- ‚úÖ **Future upgrades**: Any new workflows we add will auto-appear in your setup

### **LoRA Issues Resolved:**
- ‚úÖ **Flux LoRA selector**: Will now appear even if all LoRAs have 'hidream' in name
- ‚úÖ **HiDream continues working**: Existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **All models functional**: Flux, Flux Krea, and HiDream all have proper LoRA access

---

## üöÄ **Installation & Upgrade**

### **For Your Remote Server:**
```bash
cd /path/to/discomfy
git pull origin main
# That's it! Config migration happens automatically on next bot startup
```

### **What Happens on First Run:**
1. **Bot detects your existing config.json**
2. **Finds missing flux_krea_lora workflow** 
3. **Adds workflow from config.example.json**
4. **Saves updated config with your settings preserved**
5. **Logs: "Config migrated: added 1 missing workflows"**
6. **All three models now work perfectly!**

---

## üîç **Migration Details**

### **What Gets Added to Your Config:**
```json
"flux_krea_lora": {
  "name": "Flux Krea with LoRA",
  "description": "Enhanced Flux Krea model with LoRA support - high-quality creative generation",
  "file": "flux_krea_lora.json",
  "type": "image",
  "model_type": "flux_krea",
  "enabled": true,
  "supports_lora": true
}
```

### **What Stays Exactly the Same:**
- ‚úÖ Your ComfyUI URL: `http://172.27.1.134:8188`
- ‚úÖ Your timeout settings: `900 seconds`
- ‚úÖ Your logging configuration
- ‚úÖ Your security settings
- ‚úÖ All existing workflows (flux_lora, hidream_lora, etc.)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Migration Behavior**

### **Smart Detection Logic:**
- **Existing config.json**: Smart migration adds missing workflows
- **Missing config.json**: Full auto-creation from example (v1.2.5 behavior)
- **Up-to-date config**: No changes, works as before
- **Migration errors**: Graceful fallback, logs error, continues with existing config

### **Logging Output:**
```
INFO - Adding missing workflow: flux_krea_lora
INFO - Config migrated: added 1 missing workflows
INFO - Configuration loaded successfully
```

---

## üéØ **What You'll See After Update**

### **Model Dropdown Now Shows:**
1. **üöÄ Flux (Default)** - Your working flux model
2. **‚ú® Flux Krea ‚ú® NEW** - Now available and functional!
3. **üé® HiDream** - Your working hidream model

### **LoRA Selector:**
- **Flux**: Shows LoRA selector with all available LoRAs (fallback logic)
- **Flux Krea**: Shows same LoRAs as Flux (shared compatibility)  
- **HiDream**: Shows HiDream-specific LoRAs (existing logic preserved)

---

## üìû **Support & Verification**

### **Verify Migration Worked:**
```bash
# Check your config.json now includes flux_krea_lora
grep -A 8 "flux_krea_lora" config.json

# Check bot logs for migration messages
tail -f logs/bot.log | grep -i "config migrated"
```

### **Expected Results:**
- All three models appear in dropdown
- LoRA selector appears for all models
- No more "Selected model is not available" errors
- Your server settings preserved exactly as they were
