# Discord ComfyUI Bot - Project Plan

## Overview
A Discord bot that integrates with ComfyUI API to generate images and videos through slash commands, with modular architecture and extensive customization options.

**🎉 Repository**: [https://github.com/jmpijll/discomfy.git](https://github.com/jmpijll/discomfy.git)

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Image Generation (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Create a working Discord bot that can generate basic images using ComfyUI API

### Steps:
1. **Project Setup** ✅
   - Create virtual environment and requirements.txt
   - Set up basic project structure
   - Create configuration system

2. **Core Components** ✅
   - Implement basic bot.py with Discord connection
   - Create image_gen.py with ComfyUI API integration
   - Implement workflow JSON loading system
   - Create basic output management (save/cleanup)

3. **Basic Image Generation** ✅
   - Implement simple slash command for image generation
   - Support prompt input and basic parameters
   - Return generated image to Discord

### Testing Criteria:
- [x] Bot connects to Discord successfully
- [x] Bot responds to `/generate` command
- [x] ComfyUI API integration works
- [x] Generated images are saved and displayed in Discord
- [x] Output folder management works (100 file limit)

## ✅ Phase 2: Enhanced Features & Post-Generation Actions (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Add post-generation action buttons and streamlined user experience

### Steps:
1. **Streamlined Generation** ✅
   - Simplified `/generate` command (image-only)
   - Removed workflow parameter for cleaner UX
   - Enhanced parameter validation and error handling

2. **Post-Generation Actions** ✅
   - Added Discord UI buttons for upscaling and animation
   - Universal button access (anyone can use any generation's buttons)
   - Infinite button usage (no timeout)
   - Rate limiting per user for button interactions

3. **User Experience** ✅
   - Updated help system with clear documentation
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Enhanced progress indicators during generation

### Testing Criteria:
- [x] Users can adjust generation parameters
- [x] Post-generation buttons appear on all images
- [x] Anyone can use buttons on any generation
- [x] Buttons work indefinitely without timeout
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [x] Help system is comprehensive and accurate

## ✅ Phase 3: Video Generation & Advanced Features (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Implement actual upscaling and video generation functionality

### Steps:
1. **Upscaling Implementation** ✅
   - Connect upscale button to ComfyUI upscale workflow
   - Handle high-resolution image outputs
   - Add upscaling parameter options

2. **Video Generation Implementation** ✅
   - Connect animate button to ComfyUI video workflow
   - Implement image-to-video conversion
   - Handle MP4 file uploads to Discord
   - Add video generation parameters

3. **Advanced Features** ✅
   - Enhanced progress tracking for video generation
   - Temporary file handling for input images
   - Universal button access with rate limiting
   - Proper workflow parameter mapping

### Testing Criteria:
- [x] Upscale button generates higher resolution images
- [x] Animate button creates MP4 videos from images
- [x] Video files are properly uploaded to Discord
- [x] Progress indicators work for long operations
- [x] Temporary file cleanup works correctly
- [x] Both features work with universal button access

## 🚧 Phase 4: Polish & Production Ready (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal**: Finalize the bot for production use with comprehensive features

### Steps:
1. **Performance & Reliability** ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETE
   - ✅ Implement comprehensive error handling
   - ✅ Add logging system  
   - ✅ Optimize API calls and file handling
   - ✅ Add rate limiting and user permissions
   - ✅ Fix video generation workflow configuration
   - ✅ Improve queue management for concurrent requests
   - ✅ Add Discord interaction timeout protection
   - ✅ Implement null safety for ComfyUI API responses

2. **Advanced Workflows** 🚧 IN PROGRESS
   - Support for complex multi-node workflows
   - Dynamic parameter mapping
   - Workflow sharing between users
   - Custom workflow upload functionality

3. **Documentation & Deployment** 🚧 IN PROGRESS
   - ✅ Complete README with installation guide
   - ✅ Add troubleshooting documentation
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Add monitoring and health checks

### Testing Criteria:
- [ ] Bot handles errors gracefully without crashing
- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load
- [ ] All features work reliably
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Deployment process is smooth

## Success Metrics
- Bot uptime > 99%
- Average response time < 30 seconds for images
- Average response time < 2 minutes for videos
- Zero data loss in output management
- User-friendly error messages for all failure cases
- Complete feature coverage as specified

## Risk Mitigation
- **ComfyUI API Changes**: Implement robust error handling and API versioning
- **Discord Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and queue management
- **File Size Limits**: Implement compression and optimization for large outputs
- **Memory Usage**: Implement proper cleanup and memory management
- **User Abuse**: Implement rate limiting and user permissions
