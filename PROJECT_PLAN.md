# Discord ComfyUI Bot - Project Plan

## Overview
A Discord bot that integrates with ComfyUI API to generate images and videos through slash commands, with modular architecture and extensive customization options.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Basic Image Generation (Week 1)
**Goal**: Create a working Discord bot that can generate basic images using ComfyUI API

### Steps:
1. **Project Setup**
   - Create virtual environment and requirements.txt
   - Set up basic project structure
   - Create configuration system

2. **Core Components**
   - Implement basic bot.py with Discord connection
   - Create image_gen.py with ComfyUI API integration
   - Implement workflow JSON loading system
   - Create basic output management (save/cleanup)

3. **Basic Image Generation**
   - Implement simple slash command for image generation
   - Support prompt input and basic parameters
   - Return generated image to Discord

### Testing Criteria:
- [ ] Bot connects to Discord successfully
- [ ] Bot responds to `/generate` command
- [ ] ComfyUI API integration works
- [ ] Generated images are saved and displayed in Discord
- [ ] Output folder management works (50 file limit)

## Phase 2: Enhanced Image Features & UI (Week 2)
**Goal**: Add advanced image generation features and interactive UI elements

### Steps:
1. **Parameter Customization**
   - Implement configurable parameters (width, height, steps, cfg, etc.)
   - Add batch generation support
   - Create image collage functionality for multiple outputs

2. **Interactive UI**
   - Add Discord buttons for post-generation actions
   - Implement upscaling functionality
   - Add variation generation options

3. **Workflow Management**
   - Support multiple workflow JSON files
   - Allow users to select different workflows
   - Implement workflow validation

### Testing Criteria:
- [ ] Users can adjust generation parameters
- [ ] Batch generation creates collages correctly
- [ ] Interactive buttons work (upscale, variations)
- [ ] Multiple workflows can be selected and used
- [ ] Parameter validation prevents errors

## Phase 3: Video Generation & Advanced Features (Week 3)
**Goal**: Add video generation capabilities and advanced features

### Steps:
1. **Video Generation**
   - Implement video_gen.py component
   - Add video workflow support
   - Create image-to-video functionality
   - Handle video file uploads to Discord

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement image-to-video conversion from generated images
   - Add LoRA selection and management
   - Create preset saving/loading system
   - Add queue management for long operations

3. **User Experience**
   - Add progress indicators for long operations
   - Implement error handling and user feedback
   - Create help system and command documentation

### Testing Criteria:
- [ ] Video generation works end-to-end
- [ ] Image-to-video conversion functions correctly
- [ ] LoRA integration works
- [ ] Queue system handles multiple requests
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and clear

## Phase 4: Polish & Production Ready (Week 4)
**Goal**: Finalize the bot for production use with comprehensive features

### Steps:
1. **Performance & Reliability**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Add logging system
   - Optimize API calls and file handling
   - Add rate limiting and user permissions

2. **Advanced Workflows**
   - Support for complex multi-node workflows
   - Dynamic parameter mapping
   - Workflow sharing between users
   - Custom workflow upload functionality

3. **Documentation & Deployment**
   - Complete README with installation guide
   - Add troubleshooting documentation
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Add monitoring and health checks

### Testing Criteria:
- [ ] Bot handles errors gracefully without crashing
- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load
- [ ] All features work reliably
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Deployment process is smooth

## Success Metrics
- Bot uptime > 99%
- Average response time < 30 seconds for images
- Average response time < 2 minutes for videos
- Zero data loss in output management
- User-friendly error messages for all failure cases
- Complete feature coverage as specified

## Risk Mitigation
- **ComfyUI API Changes**: Implement robust error handling and API versioning
- **Discord Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and queue management
- **File Size Limits**: Implement compression and optimization for large outputs
- **Memory Usage**: Implement proper cleanup and memory management
- **User Abuse**: Implement rate limiting and user permissions
