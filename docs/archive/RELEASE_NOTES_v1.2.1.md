# 🐛 DisComfy v1.2.1 - Critical Bug Fix Release

**Release Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release (Critical Bug Fix)

---

## 🚨 **Critical Update Required**

This is a **critical patch release** that fixes a runtime error preventing the bot from functioning properly. **All users must update immediately** for the bot to work correctly.

---

## 🐛 **What's Fixed**

### **Runtime Error Resolution**
- **Fixed:** `NameError: name 'bot' is not defined` in slash commands
- **Impact:** `/generate` and `/edit` commands were completely broken in v1.2.0
- **Solution:** Added proper bot instance access in command functions

### **Commands Now Working**
- ✅ `/generate` - Create AI images and videos
- ✅ `/edit` - Edit images with natural language prompts
- ✅ All interactive buttons and modals
- ✅ Progress tracking and real-time updates
- ✅ Post-generation actions (upscale, animate, edit)

---

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Root Cause**
The v1.2.0 release introduced a scope issue where slash command functions couldn't access the bot instance, causing `NameError` exceptions on every command execution.

### **Fix Applied**
```python
# Added to command functions:
bot: ComfyUIBot = interaction.client
```

This properly retrieves the bot instance from the Discord interaction object, resolving all scope-related issues.
