## üìù Known Issues

### Concurrent Queue Handling
**Status:** Known Issue (Deferred)  
**Impact:** Medium

When multiple users start generations simultaneously, the second generation may not show completion in Discord until a third generation is started. This issue has been documented in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` and will be addressed in a future release.

**Workaround:** Users should wait for the current generation to complete before starting a new one.

**Note:** Single generation tracking works perfectly. Progress tracking and WebSocket updates function correctly.
