# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- **Extended Video Generation Timeout**: Increased from 10 minutes to 15 minutes (900 seconds)
- **Enhanced Video Workflow Detection**: Added support for WanVaceToVideo, VHS_VideoCombine, and AnimateDiff nodes
- **Parameter Selection Modals**: Interactive Discord modals for customizing upscale and animation parameters
- **Upscale Parameter Selection**: Choose upscale ratio (2x/4x/8x), denoise strength, and sampling steps
- **Animation Parameter Selection**: Choose frame count (81/121/161) and strength parameters
- **Original Prompt Display**: Fixed animate and upscale functions to show original image prompts

### Fixed
- **Video Generation Timeouts**: Videos can now complete successfully in 5-10 minutes without timing out
- **Workflow Detection Logic**: Properly identifies video workflows using WanVaceToVideo nodes
- **Parameter Display**: Upscale and animate operations now show the correct original prompts
- **Timeout Logging**: Clear indicators when video vs image workflow timeouts are applied

### Changed
- **Video Timeout Duration**: Extended from 600 seconds (10 min) to 900 seconds (15 min)
- **User Experience**: Added interactive parameter selection before running upscale/animate operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Maintains accuracy even with extended timeout durations

### Technical
- Enhanced video workflow detection with multiple node type support
- Improved timeout handling for long-running video generation tasks
- Added Discord modal components for parameter input
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflows

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-29

### Added
- **Advanced Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Complete WebSocket integration with ComfyUI API
- **Step-Based Progress Calculation**: Progress percentage now based purely on sampling steps
- **Client ID Management**: Proper client_id handling ensures detailed WebSocket messages
- **Multi-Phase Video Support**: Enhanced tracking for video generation with up to 161 steps
- **Fallback HTTP Polling**: Graceful degradation when WebSocket unavailable
- **Enhanced Progress Display**: Shows current sampling step (e.g., "152/161" for detailed tracking)
- **Node Execution Tracking**: Real-time updates on which ComfyUI nodes are executing
- **Cached Node Detection**: Automatically accounts for nodes skipped due to caching
- **Time Estimation**: Improved ETA calculations based on actual step progress
- **Queue Position Tracking**: Live updates when waiting in ComfyUI's generation queue

### Fixed
- **Progress Tracking Accuracy**: Now shows real progress instead of time-based estimates
- **WebSocket Integration**: Proper client_id handling ensures reception of detailed messages
- **Step Progress Calculation**: Percentage based on actual sampling steps, not node execution
- **Video Generation Support**: Enhanced tracking for video workflows with multiple sampling phases
- **Progress Update Frequency**: 1-second intervals provide smooth, responsive feedback

### Changed
- **Progress Display Format**: Enhanced with step counts, node information, and accurate percentages
- **Update Frequency**: Increased from 10 seconds to 1 second for real-time feedback
- **Timeout Detection**: Dynamic timeout based on workflow type (video vs image)
- **Error Handling**: Improved WebSocket connection resilience with HTTP polling fallback

### Technical
- Hybrid HTTP polling + WebSocket approach for maximum reliability
- Comprehensive ComfyUI API message handling (progress, executing, executed, status)
- Step-based progress calculation for accurate percentage reporting
- Enhanced logging and debugging capabilities for progress tracking
- Graceful fallback mechanisms when WebSocket unavailable
