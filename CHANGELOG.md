# Changelog

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-05

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes for Custom Workflows

### Fixed
- **LoRA Selector Error**: Fixed `'CompleteSetupView' object has no attribute 'insert_item'` error
  - Changed from non-existent `insert_item()` to correct `children.insert()` method
  - LoRA selector now initializes properly without errors
  - Credit to [@AyoKeito](https://github.com/AyoKeito) for identifying the issue

- **Custom Workflow Validation**: Fixed `"Cannot execute because a node is missing the class_type property"` error
  - Added comprehensive `_validate_workflow()` method to check workflow structure
  - Validates all nodes have required `class_type` property
  - Checks for proper workflow dictionary structure
  - Warns about missing `inputs` properties

### Added
- **Intelligent Error Messages**: New validation provides detailed, actionable error messages
  - Lists specific nodes with issues (up to 5)
  - Explains what's wrong with each node
  - Provides common solutions and export format guidance
  - Tells users to use "Save (API Format)" in ComfyUI
  - Includes example of correct node structure

### Technical Details

### Known Issues
- **Concurrent Queue Handling**: Second generation may not complete until third is started (documented in `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`)

## [1.2.11] - 2025-10-04

### üîß Critical Fix: True Persistent WebSocket Implementation

### Fixed
- **Concurrent Generation Completion**: Fixed bug where second generation never completed until third started
- **Progress Tracking**: Fixed issue where progress stayed on "Checking status..." then jumped to 100%
- **WebSocket Architecture**: Implemented single persistent WebSocket that monitors ALL generations simultaneously
- **Session Management**: WebSocket now stays alive across multiple `async with` context manager cycles

### Technical Details
- Previous fix (v1.2.10) used shared client_id but still created separate WebSocket per generation
- Multiple WebSockets competed for messages, causing progress tracking failures
- New architecture: ONE persistent WebSocket for entire bot session
- Each generation registers/unregisters with `_active_generations` dictionary
- Persistent monitor routes messages to correct generation by `prompt_id`
- WebSocket starts on first generation, persists across all subsequent generations

### Root Cause (v1.2.10)
- `async with generator` pattern created/destroyed sessions per generation
- Each generation spawned its own WebSocket connection
- Even with shared client_id, multiple connections interfered with each other
- Solution required architectural change: persistent WebSocket independent of sessions

### Impact
- ‚úÖ All concurrent generations now complete correctly without manual intervention
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress tracking works for all generations (step counts, percentages)
- ‚úÖ No more "stuck at Checking status" issues
- ‚úÖ No more requiring third generation to detect second's completion
- ‚úÖ True concurrent queue handling as originally intended

## [1.2.10] - 2025-10-03

### üêõ Critical Queue Handling Fix

### Fixed
- **Queued Generation Progress**: Fixed critical bug where generations started while another is running would never show progress percentages
- **WebSocket Client Filtering**: Removed `?clientId` parameter from WebSocket connections that was preventing queued generations from receiving progress messages
- **Completion Detection**: Fixed issue where completed generations weren't detected until a new generation started
- **Progress Message Filtering**: Implemented proper prompt-based filtering to prevent cross-contamination between concurrent generations
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Multiple users can now safely queue generations simultaneously with accurate progress tracking

### Technical Details
- Removed `?clientId={client_id}` from WebSocket connection URL (line 602) - was causing ComfyUI to filter messages per client
- WebSocket now connects without client filtering to receive ALL messages from ComfyUI
- Added `currently_executing_prompt` tracking in `_track_websocket_progress()` to identify which prompt is actually running
- Progress messages filtered by matching against currently executing prompt_id
- Each generation's WebSocket properly receives 'executing' messages to detect when its prompt starts running
- Enhanced logging to track prompt execution state transitions

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by the WebSocket connecting with `?clientId={client_id}` parameter, which made ComfyUI filter messages to only that specific client. When Generation B was queued while Generation A was running:
1. Generation B's WebSocket connected with its own client_id
2. ComfyUI filtered messages, so Generation B's WebSocket didn't receive ANY messages
3. When Generation B started executing, its WebSocket never received the 'executing' or 'progress' messages
4. Result: Generation B showed elapsed time but no progress percentage
5. HTTP polling eventually detected completion in history, but only when triggered by a new generation

### Impact
This fix resolves the core issue with concurrent generation handling. Users can now:
- Queue multiple generations that show accurate progress when running
- See "Queued" status with position while waiting
- See progress percentages and step counts when generation actually starts
- Have all generations complete properly without needing to start another generation to trigger completion detection

## [1.2.9] - 2025-10-03

### üêõ Concurrent Generation Progress Tracking Fix (Remote Release)

- **Automatic CFG Adjustment**: Optimized CFG values per workflow (1.0 for Qwen, 2.5 for Flux)
- **New Workflow Integration**: Added `qwen_image_edit.json` workflow support

### Changed
- **Command Renamed**: `/edit` ‚Üí `/editflux` (Flux Kontext high-quality editing)
- **Edit Buttons Split**: Single edit button now split into Flux and Qwen variants
- **Modal Titles**: Context-aware modal titles indicating which model is being used
- **Progress Messages**: Model-specific progress indicators and status messages

### Enhanced

- **Model-Specific Defaults**: Each model has optimized default parameters
- **Workflow Type Parameter**: Added `workflow_type` to `generate_edit()` method
- **Improved Documentation**: Updated README with dual editing model information
- **Better User Feedback**: Clear indication of which model is being used

### Technical Details
- Added `_update_qwen_edit_workflow_parameters()` method to ImageGenerator
- Updated `generate_edit()` to support both "flux" and "qwen" workflow types
- Modified edit button callbacks to pass workflow type to modals
- Enhanced modal classes to accept and handle workflow_type parameter
- Updated command registration to include both editflux and editqwen commands

### üìä Impact
