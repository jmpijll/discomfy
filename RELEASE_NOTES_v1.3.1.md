# Release Notes - DisComfy v1.3.1

**Release Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes for Custom Workflows

DisComfy v1.3.1 addresses critical issues reported in [Issue #1](https://github.com/jmpijll/discomfy/issues/1) that prevented custom workflows from loading correctly and caused LoRA selector errors.

---

## üîß What's Fixed

### Fixed LoRA Selector Initialization Error
**Issue:** `'CompleteSetupView' object has no attribute 'insert_item'`

**Root Cause:** The code was calling a non-existent `insert_item()` method on Discord's `View` class.

**Fix:** Changed to use the correct `children.insert()` method for inserting UI elements at specific positions.

**Impact:** LoRA selector now loads properly without errors when initializing the generation setup view.

### Added Comprehensive Workflow Validation
**Issue:** `"Cannot execute because a node is missing the class_type property."`

**Root Cause:** Custom workflows exported in the wrong format or missing required properties that ComfyUI needs.

**Fix:** Added new `_validate_workflow()` method that performs comprehensive validation:
- Checks for missing `class_type` property on all nodes
- Validates overall workflow structure (must be a dictionary)
- Warns about missing `inputs` properties
- Provides detailed error messages with:
  - Specific nodes that have issues
  - What properties are missing
  - How to fix the problem

**Impact:** Users now get clear, actionable error messages when loading custom workflows, making debugging much easier.

## ‚ú® New Features

### Intelligent Workflow Validation
The new validation system checks custom workflows for:

1. **Required Properties:**
   - Each node must have a `class_type` property
   - Each node must have an `inputs` property
   - Workflow must be properly structured

2. **Helpful Error Messages:**
   - Lists up to 5 problematic nodes
   - Shows exactly what's wrong with each node
   - Provides common solutions

3. **Export Format Guidance:**
   - Explains the difference between UI and API format
   - Tells users to use "Save (API Format)" in ComfyUI
   - Includes example of correct node structure

### Example Error Output
```
Workflow 'custom_workflow' has 2 invalid node(s):
  - Node #1: Missing required 'class_type' property
  - Node #5: Node is not a dictionary (got str)

Common issues:
  1. Each node must have a 'class_type' property specifying the ComfyUI node type
  2. Each node must have an 'inputs' property (can be empty dict)
  3. Workflow must be exported from ComfyUI as API format (not the UI format)

To fix: In ComfyUI, use 'Save (API Format)' instead of regular 'Save' when exporting workflows.
```

## üìù Technical Details

### Changes in `bot.py`
**Line 823:** Fixed LoRA selector initialization
```python
# Before:
self.insert_item(1, LoRASelectMenu(self.loras, self.selected_lora))

# After:
self.children.insert(1, LoRASelectMenu(self.loras, self.selected_lora))
```

### Changes in `image_gen.py`
**New Method:** `_validate_workflow()` (Lines 438-511)
- Validates workflow structure before loading
- Checks each node for required properties
- Provides detailed error messages with solutions

**Updated Method:** `_load_workflow()` (Line 429)
- Now calls `_validate_workflow()` after loading JSON
- Catches validation errors early before sending to ComfyUI

## üìö Custom Workflow Guide

### How to Create Custom Workflows

1. **Design Your Workflow in ComfyUI:**
   - Build your workflow as usual in ComfyUI
   - Test it to ensure it works correctly

2. **Export in API Format:**
   - Click the menu in ComfyUI
   - Choose **"Save (API Format)"** (NOT regular "Save")
   - Save to your `discomfy/workflows/` directory

3. **Verify Node Structure:**
   Each node should look like this:
   ```json
   {
     "1": {
       "inputs": {
         "image": "input.png"
       },
       "class_type": "LoadImage",
       "_meta": {
         "title": "Load Image"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Add to Config (Optional):**
   If you want to use it as a default workflow, add it to `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "workflows": {
       "my_custom_workflow": {
         "enabled": true,
         "name": "My Custom Workflow",
         "file": "my_custom_workflow.json",
         "description": "My custom workflow description"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
